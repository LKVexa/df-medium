# Historical DF Medium assembly guide

The original 1.0.0 guide follows. Its byte-identical payload and measurement claims describe the original assembly. See README.md and AUDIT.md for the hardened 1.0.1 derivation.

# DF_Medium -- START HERE

**DF-PA21.2-1.0.0** · fabric node **`N_MEDIUM`** · BOTTLE ROCKET 5.0.0 (frozen 4.7.0 core, ISA 4.1)

## What this is

This is the user's `Medium.zip` container VM -- the reference: LCTLC/1.1 front end, native semantic verifier, independent BRIM verifier, Ed25519 signing, BRTM/1 trust chain, Device ABI 1.0, 88/96 requirements OPERATIONAL with 8 external blockers named --
**translated into a distributed-fabric container VM** in the language defined by
the PA21.2 corpora (PA-LCTL 1.6.x, the *hyperfederated execution fabric*).

The VM package itself is embedded **byte-identical** under `vm/BOTTLE_ROCKET_5.0.0_VM_110K_RC/`
(pinned by `node/PAYLOAD_DIGEST.json`; nothing inside it was edited). Around it, this
container adds what the fabric needs to treat the VM as a **node**:

* `node/NODE.pal` -- the node declared as a PA-LCTL bundle (federation `DF0`, domain
  `D_BR`, worker group `G_ISA41`, node `N_MEDIUM`), which parses, verifies
  and seals under the reference core, and whose own witness the node computes on itself;
* `node/NODE_DESCRIPTOR.json` -- the fabric-facing description: worker, resource limits,
  feature classes (adapter spec s3 vocabulary), bounds, self-reported blockers;
* `adapter/dfabric/` -- the PA-LCTL target adapter (`PA-LCTL/TARGET_ADAPTER/1`) that binds
  this VM as a **classical** target, in the shape of the corpora's own
  `pacore.adapters.bottlerocket`, failing closed;
* `core/` -- the PA-LCTL reference core, spec set and examples, carried byte-identically
  from the corpora and pinned by `core/PACORE_DIGEST.json` (the same digest appears in all
  five DF containers);
* `BUILD` / `VERIFY` / `RUN` -- the three entry points every DF container exposes.

The governing rule, inherited from the corpora:

> No item is operational because its source file exists. Operational status requires native executable evidence satisfying that item's promotion gate.

## Capability matrix

| capability | this node |
|---|---|
| compile source | yes -- Columned LCTL, LCTLC/1.1 (`bradmin verify-lctlc` / `lctl-to-brir` / `compile-lctlc`) |
| sign images | yes -- Ed25519 (`bradmin keygen` / `sign-image` / `verify-image` / `run-signed`) |
| trust chain | yes -- BRTM/1 Root -> Issuer -> Release -> Image (root private key not packaged; secure bundles cannot be minted here) |
| device ABI | Device ABI 1.0, 8 device classes, per-run quotas; no network device by default |
| deterministic replay | yes (release/bin rebuilt bit-identical; replay/EXPECTED checked) |
| step bound | 4096 steps in the CLI (trap 24); `max_steps` in the unit header is provenance |
| guest dialect | LCTLC/1.1 (Columned LCTL, native C compiler brlctlc) |
| result register | `R2` (low 64 bits) |
| rows per witness lowering | **84** (256-instruction image ceiling; 3 instructions per row + 4) -- exceeding it is a refusal |
| qubits | **0** -- every quantum feature classifies `UNSUPPORTED`; `native_gate_set()` is empty |
| trust domain | `LOCAL_TRUSTED` (never `PHYSICAL_TARGET_AUTHENTICATED`) |
| execution label | `CLASSICAL_NATIVE_VM_BOUNDED_EXECUTION` |

## The three entry points

```
./BUILD                 compile the embedded VM in place (vm/<package>/.build); no-op where nothing compiles
./VERIFY [--full]       hashes, manifest, schemas, citations, core selfcheck, the VM's own gate (in a scratch copy),
                        then the adapter battery; exit non-zero on any FAIL; a missing dependency is SKIPPED with a reason
./RUN <program>         a .pal bundle -> its row-sequence witness executed natively on this VM (and checked against
                        the CPython reference); a native LCTLC/1.1 program -> compiled, signed, verified, run
```

Windows twins: `BUILD.cmd`, `VERIFY.cmd`, `RUN.cmd` (the C toolchain gates then report
SKIPPED unless `make`/`cc`/OpenSSL are on the PATH). Everything is offline; nothing opens a
socket (`NETWORK=deny`, `BACKEND=none`).

Examples:

```
./RUN examples/01_bell_pair.pal          # witness of the corpora's Bell-pair example on this VM
./RUN examples/add42.lctlc                # a native guest program: result register = 42
./RUN node/NODE.pal                      # this node witnesses its own declaration
python3 -B adapter/dfabric/cli.py node-attest
```

`REQUIREMENTS.txt` declares the toolchain; `VERIFY` checks it **first**.

## Measured on the assembly host, from the delivered bytes

`conformance/DF_GATE_RESULTS.json` (logs in `conformance/logs/`):

| gate | statement | result | time |

| `N1` | the VM's own build (stock flags) and its own acceptance gate reproduce | **PASS** | 21.32s |
| `A1` | adapter attestation (PA-LCTL/TARGET_ADAPTER/1): LOCAL_TRUSTED, CLASSICAL_ label, no physical flag, empty gate set | **PASS** | 0.001s |
| `A2` | physical-evidence firewall: three physical claims are refused at construction | **PASS** | 0.0s |
| `A3` | row-sequence witness executes natively and agrees with the CPython reference on 7 bundles | **PASS** | 0.21s |
| `A4` | witness sensitivity: cell change, row reorder, row delete, row insert each change the native witness | **PASS** | 0.145s |
| `A5` | stated bounds are refusals: max_rows+1 refused (SUPPORTED_WITH_LIMITS), max_rows executes | **PASS** | 0.032s |
| `A6` | declared step budget is enforced: an unbounded loop traps (BUDGET / TRAP_RESOURCE) instead of running | **PASS** | 0.029s |
| `A7` | deterministic replay: the same rows lower to the same source and image and produce the same witness twice | **PASS** | 0.062s |
| `A8` | shots > 1, a wrong QCIR-P2 schema and an empty row list are refused, never answered | **PASS** | 0.001s |
| `A9` | a native LCTLC/1.1 program (examples/add42.lctlc) runs and returns 42 | **PASS** | 0.028s |
| `A10` | equivalence with the corpora's own adapter: lowering byte-identical to pacore.adapters.brlower and identical witness via pacore.adapters.bottlerocket | **PASS** | 0.062s |
| `A11` | the corpora's own backend suite (pamath/tests/test_bottlerocket_backend.py, 30 checks) passes against this node | **PASS** | 0.137s |

**18 passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped** in 22.667 s on `Linux-6.18.5-fc-v20-x86_64-with-glibc2.39` (Python 3.11.15, `/usr/bin/cc`).

`G0.1`/`G0.2` cannot run before the seal (this results file is part of what they hash); they passed in the
post-seal `./VERIFY` recorded in the delivery's `_assembly/` folder, and they run first in every `./VERIFY` on your machine.

The VM's own build and acceptance gate, run with its stock flags in a scratch copy of the
embedded payload (`make operational`; 40 semantic cases, ISA/ABI conformance (32 opcodes, 20 services, 14 traps), wide-state 59/59, device I/O 66/66, secure execution R2.low64=42, source boundary 107,675/110,000, BRIM 272/51,200):

Row-sequence witnesses executed natively on this VM and compared with the CPython reference

Native guest program `examples/add42.lctlc`: `R2` = **42**.

## What is not claimed

* **Quantum execution.** The VM has no qubit. The witness proves that the sealed row
  sequence survived lowering, compilation, signing and native execution intact under a
  declared step budget; it proves nothing about quantum semantics (`spec/DF_NODE_SPEC.md` s5).
* **Physical anything.** `PHYSICAL_PARALLEL_QPU_EXECUTION` and
  `PHYSICAL_DISTRIBUTED_QPU_EXECUTION` remain `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY`; the adapter's
  constructor refuses any physical claim (gate `A2`).
* **Cross-machine federation.** `NETWORK=deny`: the fabric is a model of a federation
  executed on one host with local processes (`PA_LCTL_FABRIC_SPEC.md` s1).
* **The target's own blockers**, inherited verbatim from PACKAGE_INFO.json (`strict_gate: BLOCKED`, 88/96 OPERATIONAL, 8 BLOCKED) and not
  lifted by binding it to the fabric:
  * independent second-machine/operator replay
  * independent second-machine/operator rebuild
  * literal 72-hour native soak
  * AArch64 and Windows execution qualification
  * final 100% evidence ledger dependent on those proofs

`reports/DF_BLOCKED_REGISTER.md` lists everything else that is not operational, with a reason.

## Things worth knowing about this VM (measured)

* Units must declare `version=4.7.0` and `image_version=9`: 5.0.0 is a qualification overlay on the frozen 4.7.0 executable core.
* The Core-61 figure is 48,264 B in the re-sealed evidence and 49,072 B in the README (both under 61,000).
* This is the target the corpora's own adapter (`pacore.adapters.bottlerocket`) binds; the DF adapter reproduces its lowering byte for byte.
